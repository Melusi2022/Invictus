Installation
To run the Invictus payment system locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/Melusi2022/invictus.git
cd invictus
Install dependencies:

bash
npm install
Create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following environment variables:

makefile
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
Run the server:

bash
npm start
The server will start on http://localhost:5000.

Usage
Run the server
You can start the server using npm start. By default, the app runs on http://localhost:5000. Use a tool like Postman or cURL to interact with the API.

bash
npm start
Development mode
To run the app in development mode (using nodemon), use:

bash
npm run dev
This will watch for file changes and restart the server automatically.
